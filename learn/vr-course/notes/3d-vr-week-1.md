## 3D Graphics

Currently the only way to create fully immersive interactive virtual reality experiences that you step into and interact with is to use 3D graphics. 

Computer graphics is the process of taking representation of objects and worlds that are entirely on the computer and using them to
create potentially highly realistic and compelling images. Though these images can also be very abstract and cartoony, if you like, the basic principle of computer graphics is that we represent objects and environments as computer files, primarily as a bunch of numbers.

The process of computer graphics, called rendering, is to turn these 3D representations into 2D images that can be viewed on a computer screen which in our case is a head-mounted display. This process of rendering is handled by modern computer graphics hardware and very sophisticated graphics  software. 

VR creators don't have to think very much at all about how the objects are turned into images. Our jobs as creators is to create those representations of 3D objects.

## 3D Engines

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. Its a set of developer tool used to create applications, such as virtual reality applications.

Our Environment for creating virtual reality is Unity.

### A-Frame

A-Frame is a framework for developing WebVR experiences. So, it makes a lot of the kind of nitty-gritty stuff of developing WebVR a little bit simpler. It has all the documentation for developing experiences.

## OpenVR 

OpenVR is a software Development kit. It is written in C++ and it gives low level access to some of the VR headsets that are currently out right now including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. 

It gives you some of the most important things that you need from headsets such as their positions, and for the position of controllers and the data from all the hardware. It gives you direct access to the hardware, it's the interface that's provided by Valve.

OpenVR is good because you could easily integrate it into the software you had already and it's because it's on a lower level.
